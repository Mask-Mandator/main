Recipient of funding from COVID-19 hackathon fund by Google Cloud + mentorship.

Mask Mandator is a campus-wide system that enforces the proper usage of masks before entry into common areas and other population dense buildings. Our idea was to combine already widely used card/ID systems with cameras and AI to detect if someone is properly protecting themselves and others by wearing a mask before entering. The system would check with a cloud hosted data base to match students IDs with data such as if they're immunocompromised and the number of mask infractions they've had in the past and act accordingly to grant or reject the student access.

This project won the Second Place [FCA] Artificial Intelligence Theme, First Place [Google Cloud] Best Use of Google Cloud, Google Cloud COVID-19 Response Hack Finalist, and Fourth Place [Wolfram] Top 15 Teams at HackRPI 2020
